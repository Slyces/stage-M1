 * Type: Node
 * ----------
 * This type defines all informations associated with a node.
 * A node is represented by the following informations:
 *   - id: an int, unique to each node
 *   - table: the routign table of this node.
 *   - functionsArray: an array of adaptation functions, representing
 *                     the protocols this node is able to handle
 *   - functionsNumber: size of this array.
 *   - in, out: arrays of protocol stacks accepted as input (resp. output).
 *   - inSize, outSize: size of the corresponding arrays;
 *   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *   # Some statistics for the simulation
 *   - confReceived, confSent: counts the configuration messages sent
 *                             and received while building the
 *                             routing table.
 *   - messageReceived: counts the messages received directly by this
 *                      node.
 *   - messageRouted: counts the messages routed by this node.
 *   - messageDiscarded: counts the invalid messages thrown by this
 *                       node.

 * When a router receives a new configuration message, it does several things:
 *   - is the top protocol a valid output ? No â†’ discard the message
 *   - for each valid function, see what stack I should receive to output this
 *     stack
 *   - look up the duo (stack, dest) in my table
 *   - add / replace it if the cost is cheaper
